This motivates analytical and policy analysis of the Indian criminal justice system. What are the inter-relationships between safety and economics, and between safety and democratic politics? How safe are individuals in India? What coping mechanisms are being used, and what is the opportunity cost of these coping mechanisms? What is the present resourcing of the criminal justice system, and how are resources being translated into outcomes by courts, police, prisons, CBI under present laws? How can the levers of policy be applied to do things better? How should we think about criminal justice system reform? "
